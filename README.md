2️⃣ Abstract

This project focuses on building a real-time Generative AI (Gen AI) system for automatic image colorization. The system converts grayscale images into colored images using deep learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on a dataset of colored images to learn color patterns and textures. The trained model predicts realistic colors for new grayscale images in real time. This project demonstrates how Generative AI can be applied in image processing tasks such as restoring old photographs and enhancing historical images.




3️⃣ Introduction

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is a branch of AI that can generate new content such as images, text, and audio. One important application of Gen AI is image colorization.

Image colorization is the process of adding color to grayscale images automatically. Traditionally, this task required manual editing. With advancements in Deep Learning, especially CNNs, machines can now learn color patterns and generate realistic colored images.

Applications include:

Restoration of old black-and-white photographs

Film and video enhancement

Historical image reconstruction

Creative media design





4️⃣ Literature Survey

Earlier methods used manual color mapping and required user interaction. These methods were time-consuming and less accurate.

Modern approaches use:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Autoencoders

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)


Gen AI models learn from large datasets and automatically generate realistic colors. These techniques provide better performance and high-quality results.
